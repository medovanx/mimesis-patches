# Minimap changelog

## 1.6.3
- Thunderstore version: no updater code at all (mod managers handle updates). The GitHub / installer version keeps the in-game Update button

## 1.6.2
- AI disclosure in the README and the DLL
- Installed from a mod manager (Gale, r2modman): updates come from the mod manager; no self-updating
- README: uninstalling from a mod manager

## 1.6.1
- Installed from a mod manager (r2modman, Gale): updates come from the mod manager; the Patches window no longer checks GitHub or updates itself.
- AI disclosure added to the README and the DLL.

## 1.6.0
- Now a MelonLoader mod, the loader MIMESIS mods on Thunderstore use. Installer 5.0 sets up MelonLoader and moves existing installs over.

## 1.5.0
- Now a BepInEx 5 plugin: the game files are no longer modified. Installer 4.0 sets up BepInEx and moves existing installs over.

## 1.4.4
- Patches window: move it by the title bar and resize it from any edge or corner (remembered). Download progress stays on one line.

## 1.4.3
- Patches window: Update all in the title bar; updates ask in a popup and show download progress, speed and time left.

## 1.4.2
- Patches window: update patches from inside the game, scrollable options, section headings, roomier layout, resizable from the bottom-right corner.

## 1.4.1
- Shorter, clearer option text in the Patches window.

## 1.3.2
- Legend lists only enabled categories (no "You"); hidden when none are enabled.

## 1.3.1
- Bigger dots on the map (12 px instead of 7).

## 1.3.0
- Colour legend under the map: You, plus Players / Monsters / Items when enabled.

## 1.2.2
- Graphic style scrolls smoothly: each render covers a larger area and the image slides with you between renders.

## 1.2.1
- Graphic style: the level is lit evenly for the minimap render only (dark rooms no longer show black); the game's own view is unchanged.

## 1.2.0
- Show options in the settings window: Players / Monsters / Items (off by default). Enabled ones get coloured dots, and models in Graphic style. Mimics count as monsters.

## 1.1.0
- Settings window: click the Minimap chip on the main menu to choose Reveal (Explored / Full map) and Style (Plain / Graphic).
- Graphic style: real top-down view from a camera above your head, with all players, mimics and monsters hidden from it.
- Moved to the bottom-left corner; works in the tram/lobby too (A* graph fallback).
- Main menu chips are hidden outside the main menu (all patches).

## 1.0.0
- Bottom-left floor-plan minimap built from the level's NavMesh: layout and your own arrow only.
- Explored-only or whole-map mode, switched by clicking the Minimap chip on the main menu. M toggles it in game.
