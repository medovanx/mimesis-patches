## Unreleased
- **Linux (Steam with Proton)**: [`linux/mimesis-patches.py`](linux/README.md) installs, updates, builds and removes the patches, like the Windows installer: MelonLoader, the Wine DLL override in the game's Proton prefix, and the patches built against your game.
- **Game update EA 0.4.0**: BiggerLobby, HostOptions, HudPercent, Inventory, LateJoin and PSController are ported to the new game; Fov and SpectatorCam fixed for its new features; Revive fixed; Minimap and FpsCounter checked. Details in each patch's CHANGELOG.
- All patches: the Patches chip shows on the EA 0.4.0 main menu again. Under Proton the window's Update buttons show the Linux command to run (with a Copy button, for the same source and checkout as the install) instead of downloading and starting the Windows installer. Other Wine setups (CrossOver or Whisky on macOS) keep the installer.
- Building: `dotnet build` finds the game on Linux too (`MIMESIS_DIR`, or the default Steam, Flatpak or Snap Steam library) and says clearly when it can't. The patches build with the .NET SDK 8 or newer.

## All patches (BiggerLobby 1.3.0, PSController 1.3.0, SpectatorCam 1.1.0, Minimap 1.4.0, HostOptions 1.1.0, HudPercent 1.1.0)
- One **Patches** chip on the main menu replaces the per-patch chips. It opens a window: installed patches on the left, the selected patch's options on the right, with update links.
- New options: BiggerLobby difficulty scaling on/off; PSController icons on/off; SpectatorCam, HudPercent and Minimap on/off; HostOptions stamina and starting money; Minimap settings moved here from its own window.
